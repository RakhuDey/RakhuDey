### Hi 👋
  -I am Rakhu Dey <br/>
  -Welcome to my gitHub  <br/>
  -I caught fire coding  <br/>
  I love applying responsive websites principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still looking amazing.         It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I am kind of like those web pages. I am moldable,
  but I still keep my creative flare intact.
